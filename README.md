# CIS194: Introduction to Haskell (Spring 2013)

This repository contains my solutions to the homework assignments for [Brent Yorgey's](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/) University of Pennsylvania class, [CIS 194: Introduction to Haskell (Spring 2013)](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/). This class is often the [first recommendation](https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell#how-should-i-learn-haskell) for developers who want to learn Haskell.

Please do not copy these solutionsâ€”it does you no good! You will not learn the material by copying someone else's work. Instead, you should slow down, think over the problems, and try to solve them on your own.
